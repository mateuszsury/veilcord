THIRD-PARTY LICENSES
================================================================================

Veilcord incorporates open-source libraries with their own licenses:

- cryptography (Apache License 2.0 / BSD)
- DoubleRatchet, X3DH (MIT)
- aiortc (BSD)
- React, Vite, Tailwind CSS (MIT)
- DeepFilterNet (MIT)
- MediaPipe (Apache License 2.0)
- Pedalboard (GPLv3 with commercial exception)
- SQLCipher (BSD-style)
- PyInstaller (GPLv2 with exception for bundled applications)

See each library's LICENSE file for full terms. These libraries' licenses
apply only to the libraries themselves, not to Veilcord as a whole.

Note: Pedalboard (Spotify) uses GPLv3 with a commercial exception for audio
plugin hosts. Veilcord's use of Pedalboard as a library falls under this
exception, but modifications to Pedalboard itself would be subject to GPLv3.
