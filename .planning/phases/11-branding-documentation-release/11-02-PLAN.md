<objective>
Create Veilcord logo and multi-resolution Windows icon assets.

Purpose: Professional branding requires a recognizable logo and crisp icons at all Windows display scales. The current icon.ico is a placeholder from Phase 1.

Output: Logo PNG (1024x1024) and multi-resolution ICO (16-256px) with Veilcord branding.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create logo concept using Pillow</name>
  <files>assets/logo.png</files>
  <action>
Create a programmatic logo using Python Pillow that represents the Veilcord brand:

**Design concept:** "V" shape with encryption/veil theme
- Primary color: Blood red (#991b1b)
- Background: Transparent
- Style: Simple, modern, recognizable at small sizes

Create a Python script to generate the logo:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
import os

# Create 1024x1024 transparent canvas
size = 1024
img = Image.new('RGBA', (size, size), (0, 0, 0, 0))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)

# Brand colors
blood_red = (153, 27, 27, 255)  # #991b1b
dark_bg = (30, 31, 34, 255)     # #1e1f22

# Draw a stylized "V" with shield-like shape
# Shield outline points (centered, large)
margin = 100
center_x = size // 2
top_y = margin
bottom_y = size - margin
mid_y = size * 0.4

# V-shaped shield points
points = [
    (center_x, bottom_y),           # Bottom point
    (margin, top_y),                # Top left
    (margin, mid_y),                # Left mid
    (center_x, size * 0.7),         # Inner bottom
    (size - margin, mid_y),         # Right mid
    (size - margin, top_y),         # Top right
]

# Draw filled shield
draw.polygon(points, fill=blood_red, outline=None)

# Add inner "veil" pattern - simple diagonal lines suggesting encryption
line_color = (200, 50, 50, 100)  # Lighter red, semi-transparent
for i in range(5):
    offset = i * 80 + 200
    draw.line([(offset, top_y + 50), (offset - 200, mid_y)], fill=line_color, width=20)

# Save
os.makedirs('assets', exist_ok=True)
img.save('assets/logo.png', 'PNG')
print("Logo saved to assets/logo.png")
```

Run this script to generate the logo. The design should be:
- Simple enough to recognize at 16x16
- Professional looking
- Using brand colors (blood red on transparent)

If the programmatic approach doesn't look good, note that manual design is needed in checkpoint.

```bash
# Verify logo exists and has correct dimensions
python -c "from PIL import Image; img = Image.open('assets/logo.png'); print(f'Logo: {img.size}, Mode: {img.mode}')"

# Should output: Logo: (1024, 1024), Mode: RGBA
```
  </verify>
  <done>
    - logo.png exists at assets/logo.png
    - Image is 1024x1024 RGBA (transparent background)
    - Uses brand red color (#991b1b)
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Generate multi-resolution ICO from logo</name>
  <files>assets/icon.ico</files>
  <action>
Convert the logo to a multi-resolution Windows ICO file containing all required sizes:

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

# Load the logo
logo = Image.open('assets/logo.png')

# Required sizes for Windows (16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256)
sizes = [16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256]

# Generate resized versions with high-quality resampling
icons = []
for s in sizes:
    # Use LANCZOS for high quality downscaling
    resized = logo.resize((s, s), Image.LANCZOS)
    icons.append(resized)

# Save as multi-resolution ICO
# PIL/Pillow supports saving multiple sizes in one ICO
logo.save('assets/icon.ico', format='ICO', sizes=[(s, s) for s in sizes])

print(f"Icon saved with sizes: {sizes}")

# Verify the ICO
ico = Image.open('assets/icon.ico')
print(f"ICO format: {ico.format}, size: {ico.size}")
if hasattr(ico, 'info') and 'sizes' in ico.info:
    print(f"Embedded sizes: {ico.info['sizes']}")
```

Run this script to generate the multi-resolution ICO.

**Note:** Windows caches icons aggressively. After rebuilding with new icon, the .exe must be renamed or copied to a new location to see the updated icon.

  <verify>
```bash
# Verify ICO exists and contains multiple sizes
python -c "
from PIL import Image
ico = Image.open('assets/icon.ico')
print(f'ICO format: {ico.format}')
print(f'Default size: {ico.size}')
# Try to get all sizes
try:
    ico.load()
    print('ICO loaded successfully')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Load error: {e}')
"

# Check file size (multi-res ICO should be larger than single-size)
ls -la assets/icon.ico
```
  </verify>
  <done>
    - icon.ico contains sizes: 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256
    - File is ready for PyInstaller
    - Previous placeholder icon replaced
  </done>

  <what-built>
Logo and icon assets for Veilcord branding:
- assets/logo.png (1024x1024 master logo)
- assets/icon.ico (multi-resolution Windows icon)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open `assets/logo.png` in an image viewer
   - Should show a stylized shield/V shape in blood red (#991b1b)
   - Background should be transparent
   - Design should be recognizable

2. Open `assets/icon.ico` in Windows (right-click > Preview or open with Photos)
   - Should display the same logo design
   - Check it looks crisp

3. Optional: Test in PyInstaller build
   - Run: `pyinstaller --clean build.spec`
   - Check dist/Veilcord/Veilcord.exe has the new icon
   - Remember: May need to rename .exe or copy to new location to bypass icon cache

If the programmatic logo doesn't look professional enough, consider:
- Using Canva (canva.com/create/logos/) to design a better logo
- Using ConvertICO.com to create the multi-resolution ICO
- The simple programmatic approach can be replaced with a manually designed logo
  </how-to-verify>
