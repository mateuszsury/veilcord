<objective>
Build production binary and create GitHub release v1.0.0 with downloadable .exe.

Purpose: Enable users to download and use Veilcord without building from source. The release page is the primary distribution channel.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build frontend for production</name>
  <files>frontend/dist/</files>
  <action>
Build the React frontend for production:

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already)
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

cd ..
```

Verify build output:
- frontend/dist/index.html exists
- frontend/dist/assets/ contains JS and CSS bundles
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
ls -la frontend/dist/
ls frontend/dist/assets/ | head -5
```
  </verify>
  <done>
    - frontend/dist/ contains production build
    - index.html and assets bundles exist
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build PyInstaller executable</name>
  <files>dist/Veilcord/</files>
  <action>
Build the Windows executable with PyInstaller:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Clean build (important after rebranding)
pyinstaller --clean build.spec
```

This will:
- Read build.spec configuration
- Bundle Python + dependencies
- Include frontend/dist/
- Use assets/icon.ico for application icon
- Output to dist/Veilcord/Veilcord.exe

**If build fails:**
- Check all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check frontend is built: `ls frontend/dist/`
- Check icon exists: `ls assets/icon.ico`
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Verify executable exists
ls -la dist/Veilcord/Veilcord.exe

# Check dist folder size (should be 100-500MB depending on dependencies)
du -sh dist/Veilcord/

  <name>Task 3: Create distributable archive and checksums</name>
  <files>None (creates zip in dist/)</files>
  <action>
Create a distributable ZIP archive and generate checksums:

```bash
cd dist

# Create ZIP archive
# Windows PowerShell:
powershell Compress-Archive -Path Veilcord -DestinationPath Veilcord-v1.0.0-Windows.zip

# Or with 7-Zip if available:
# 7z a Veilcord-v1.0.0-Windows.zip Veilcord/

# Generate SHA256 checksum
# Windows:
certutil -hashfile Veilcord-v1.0.0-Windows.zip SHA256 > checksums.txt

# Add filename to checksums for clarity
echo "" >> checksums.txt
echo "File: Veilcord-v1.0.0-Windows.zip" >> checksums.txt

cd ..
```

Checksums file format:
```
SHA256 hash of file Veilcord-v1.0.0-Windows.zip:

**If gh CLI not available:**
1. Go to github.com/mateuszsury/veilcord/releases/new
2. Tag: v1.0.0 (create new tag)
3. Title: Veilcord v1.0.0 - Initial Release
4. Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md [1.0.0] section
