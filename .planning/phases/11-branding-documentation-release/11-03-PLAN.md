<objective>
Create comprehensive documentation suite for Veilcord: README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, and community files.

Purpose: Professional open source projects require clear documentation explaining the project, its features, how to use it, and how to contribute. The dual license (personal free, commercial paid) requires explicit terms.

Output: Complete documentation ready for GitHub publication.

Veilcord is a privacy-focused peer-to-peer encrypted messaging application for Windows. No central servers store your messages, no cloud services have access to your data - just secure, direct communication between you and your contacts.

## Features

### Security First
- **End-to-end encryption** using Signal Protocol (Double Ratchet + X3DH)
- **Perfect forward secrecy** - compromised keys don't expose past messages
- **Post-compromise security** - automatic recovery from key compromise
- **Zero knowledge** - all encryption happens locally on your device
- **Secure local storage** - SQLCipher encrypted database with Windows DPAPI

### Rich Communication
- **Text messaging** with read receipts, typing indicators, and reactions
- **Voice calls** with low-latency Opus codec
- **Video calls** with real-time camera sharing
- **Screen sharing** for presentations and collaboration
- **File transfer** up to 5GB with progress tracking and resume
- **Voice messages** up to 5 minutes with waveform visualization
- **Group chats** with Sender Keys encryption (up to 8 members)
- **Group calls** using mesh topology for lowest latency

### Audio & Video Effects
- **Noise cancellation** powered by DeepFilterNet AI
- **Voice effects** (pitch shift, reverb, echo, robot voice)
- **Background blur** and virtual backgrounds
- **Beauty filters** (smoothing, brightness adjustment)
- **Creative filters** (vintage, noir, dramatic)
- **AR overlays** (glasses, hats, masks)

### Modern Interface
- **Discord-inspired layout** with dark theme
- **Smooth animations** using Framer Motion
- **Virtual scrolling** for performance with large message history
- **Desktop notifications** with Windows Action Center integration
- **Auto-updates** with cryptographic verification

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/mateuszsury/veilcord/releases)
2. Extract `Veilcord-v1.0.0-Windows.zip`
3. Run `Veilcord.exe`

### First Launch

1. On first launch, Veilcord generates your cryptographic identity
2. Your public key is your shareable ID - find it in Settings
3. Add contacts by pasting their public key
4. When both online, start chatting!

### Connecting to Contacts

Veilcord uses peer-to-peer connections. For two people to chat:

1. Both must have each other added as contacts
2. Both must be online simultaneously
3. Connection is established directly (no server relay)

**Note:** Some network configurations (symmetric NAT) may prevent direct connections. Veilcord will show a clear error message if connection fails.

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         Veilcord                             │
├──────────────────┬──────────────────┬───────────────────────┤
│   React Frontend │  Python Backend   │   WebRTC P2P          │
│   (TypeScript)   │  (PyWebView)      │   (aiortc)            │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│   UI Components  │  Crypto Layer     │   Data Channels       │
│   Zustand State  │  Signal Protocol  │   Audio/Video Tracks  │
│   Framer Motion  │  SQLCipher DB     │   DTLS-SRTP           │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┴───────────────────────┘
```

### Encryption

- **Key Exchange:** X3DH (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) for initial setup
- **Message Encryption:** Double Ratchet with AES-256-GCM
- **Group Encryption:** Sender Keys protocol
- **Transport:** WebRTC DTLS-SRTP for calls, encrypted data channels for messages
- **Local Storage:** SQLCipher with Windows DPAPI key protection

### Signaling

A lightweight signaling server helps establish P2P connections:
- Relays WebRTC offers/answers between peers
- Broadcasts online status
- **Does NOT store messages or have encryption keys**

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/mateuszsury/veilcord.git
cd veilcord

# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start frontend dev server
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run Python backend in dev mode
python -m src.main --dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..

# Build executable
pyinstaller --clean build.spec

# Output: dist/Veilcord/Veilcord.exe
```

## Security

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

- Email: [security contact]
- Do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities

### Security Model

Veilcord assumes:
- Your local machine is trusted
- Your Windows user account is secure
- The signaling server is untrusted (cannot read messages)
- Network attackers cannot break modern cryptography

Veilcord does NOT protect against:
- Malware on your machine
- Screenshots/screen recording by other apps
- Physical access to your unlocked computer
- Compromised Windows user account
